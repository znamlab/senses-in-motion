<h2>Meeting themes and objectives</h2>
  <p>
 Experiments in sensory physiology have traditionally relied on recordings in restrained animals to allow precise control over stimulus parameters and animal behaviour. However, in the real world, sensory perception involves continuous interaction between movements of the observer and sensory inputs. The conference will bring together a diverse community of researchers investigating how the brain processes and interprets sensory signals as animals actively explore their environment and guides behavior under naturalistic conditions. Talks will cover a wide range of technical, experimental, and computational approaches across sensory systems and animal species. The goal of this meeting is to encourage exchange of knowledge and ideas, foster collaboration, and enable discussion on current scientific and technological challenges in this emerging field. Broad themes of the meeting include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How do sensory signals, self-motion and spatial orientation interact to enable perception and behavior? </li>
<li>How does sensory feedback guide animals’ movements?</li>
<li>How do sensory representations in freely moving animals relate to those recorded under head restrained and / or passive conditions? </li>
<li>How can new technologies enable neural recordings, behavioral quantification, and control over sensory stimulation in freely moving animals?</li>
</ul>
