# About this website

This website is largely based on the [template](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab)
provided by [the Allan lab](http://www.allanlab.org/) and includes some code
adapted from the website of [the Bedford lab](https://bedford.io/). It is powered
by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses some [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com),
[Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com), and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
The source code is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/znamlab/znamlab.github.io)
for version control and is freely available under MIT license. The website is hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Special thanks to Bat Lab at Johns Hopkins University for the video used to create the site's banner.
